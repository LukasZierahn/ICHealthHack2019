White blood cells (neutrophil) attack pathogen cells once these exceed a certain (int) MIN_NUMBER_OF_PATHOGENS.

There will be different strains of bacteria attacking cells and being attacked by neutrophils.
Upon random assignment of white blood cell or specific strain of bacteria, there a description of the cell/phagocyte's role will be given.

SPECIFIC ROLE OF NEUTROPHILS:
Abundant in the blood, these quickly enter tissues and phagocytize pathogens.
Making up 50% of all white blood cells, they are short-lived(8 hours) and highly mobile (1000X speed of all other cells)
